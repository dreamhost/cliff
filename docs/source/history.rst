  - Fix problem with interactive mode ``help`` command.
  - Disable logging by default but add a ``--log-file`` option to
    re-enable it at runtime.

1.1.2

  - Fix a packaging problem introduced in version 1.1.

1.1

  - Move tablib support (JSON, YAML, and HTML formatters) to a
    separate project to comply with Ubuntu packaging requirements. See
    https://github.com/dreamhost/cliff-tablib

1.0

  - Add trailing newlines after output from tablib-based formatters
    (JSON, YAML, and HTML). Contributed by Matt Joyce.
  - Some :pep:`8` fixes.
  - Refactor the API in :class:`Command` to add :func:`take_action`
    and make :func:`run` a concrete method. Existing users should only
    need to rename :func:`run()` to :func:`take_action()` since the
    function signatures have not changed.
  - In :class:`Lister` and :class:`ShowOne` use :func:`take_action`
    instead of :func:`get_data`.
