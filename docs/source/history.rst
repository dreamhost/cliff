dev

- Update the pyparsing dependency to a version that supports both
  Python 2 and Python 3.

1.4.4

- Provide better error handling for unknown commands run from the
  command line. (Contributed by Christophe Chauvet.)

1.4.3

- More stdout encoding issues with Python 2.6.

1.4.2

1.4.1

- Add ``dict2columns`` method to ``ShowOne``. (Contributed by Dean
  Troyer)
- Pin the requirement for cmd2 more tightly.

- Store a reference to the InteractiveApp on the App while in
  interactive mode to allow commands to update the interactive
  state. (Contributed by Tomaz Muraus)
- Remove reliance on distribute, now that it has merged with
  setuptools 0.7. Providing an explicit dependency on setuptools
  breaks updates in some cases, so just fail if it isn't there.

1.3.3

  - Restore compatibility with prettytable < 0.7.2 by forcing no
    output if there is no data (instead of printing an empty
    table). Contributed by Dirk Mueller.

1.3.2

  - Add ``convert_underscores`` parameter to ``CommandManager`` ``__init__``
    method to allow underscores to be used in command names. This optional
    argument is defaulted to True to maintain current behavior.
    (contributed by Joe Server)
  - Use flake8_ for style checking.
  - Relax version requirement for PrettyTable dependency to allow
    point releases of 0.7.

1.3.1

  - Sort list of commands in interactive help mode. (contributed by
    Ilya Shakhat)
  - Fix a dependency issue with PyParsing until the cmd2 package can
    release an update setting the version of its dependency based on
    the Python version.

1.3

  - Allow user to pass ``argparse_kwargs`` argument to the
    ``build_option_parser`` method. This argument can contain extra
    keyword arguments which are passed to the ``ArgumentParser`` constructor.
    (contributed by Tomaz Muraus)
  - Updated documentation to include dependency on distribute.

1.2.1

  - Fix problem with documentation packaging.
  - Fix problem with missing ``izip`` import in ``lister.py``.

  - Fix problem with interactive mode ``help`` command.
  - Disable logging by default but add a ``--log-file`` option to
    re-enable it at runtime.
  - Add support for python 2.6. (contributed by Mark McClain for
    OpenStack Quantum)

1.1.2

  - Fix a packaging problem introduced in version 1.1.

1.1

  - Move tablib support (JSON, YAML, and HTML formatters) to a
    separate project to comply with Ubuntu packaging requirements. See
    https://github.com/dreamhost/cliff-tablib

1.0

  - Add trailing newlines after output from tablib-based formatters
    (JSON, YAML, and HTML). Contributed by Matt Joyce.
  - Some :pep:`8` fixes.
  - Refactor the API in :class:`Command` to add :func:`take_action`
    and make :func:`run` a concrete method. Existing users should only
    need to rename :func:`run()` to :func:`take_action()` since the
    function signatures have not changed.
  - In :class:`Lister` and :class:`ShowOne` use :func:`take_action`
    instead of :func:`get_data`.

    used in initialization work.

    OpenStack clients catch up to the API change.

0.5

  - Asking for help about a command by prefix lists all matching
    commands.
  - Add formatters for HTML, JSON, and YAML.
